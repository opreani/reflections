When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

When you want to keep track more clearly of your changes and also if you dont want to stack up your internal storage

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Not every change has to be pulled to the computer as you know best what to push and pull rather than leaving it on auto

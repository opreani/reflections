When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

When you want to keep track more clearly of your changes and also if you dont want to stack up your internal storage

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Not every change has to be pulled to the computer as you know best what to push and pull rather than leaving it on auto

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You may want to fork a repository so that you have acces to it and add your own commits, you may clone another repostory so that you
have it on your computer and work with the files and you may use branches when you are making changes that you don't want to
commit to the master branch so you use another branch for testing.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can see what changes were made even if you go ofline
